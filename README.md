## 📞 NEED HELP?

**Common Questions:**

→ See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - detailed instructions for each platform

**"Will this work without the backend?"**
→ YES! Your website is fully functional now. Backend adds customer portal, payments, etc.

**"How do I test before going live?"**
→ Open index.html in your browser right now! It works!

**"What about the database?"**
→ Not needed yet. Add it later when you want customer portal features.
